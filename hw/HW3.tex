	\section{Gas Stations on Freeway}
	This problem is very similar to the activity selection problem. In the activity selection
	problem, we have a set of activities $a_i$, such that they all have a start time and a finish
	time $s_i$ and $f_i$. In this problem, we try to obtain the maximum set of activities that we 
	can take part in, given some time window. We can think of the gas stations on some freeway in 
	a similar light. We have $n$ possible locations to open a gas station. Each of their locations
	are denoted in increasing order $l_1,l_2,\ldots,l_n$. Any two gas stations that we open must be
	$k$ miles apart from one another, which translates to our gas stations have a start time of $l_i$,
	and a finish time of $l_i + k$. We have an additional parameter $p_i$, which represents the profit 
	that we can expect to receive from opening a gas station at $l_i$.
	We can denote $S_ij$ to be the set of gas stations that can be placed in between $l_i + k$ and $l_j$.
	We wish to find the maximal profit set $L_{ij}$ which includes some location $l_j$.
